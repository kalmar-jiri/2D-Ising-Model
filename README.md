# 2D Ising Model

Python simulation of basic spin magnetic Ising model on 2D lattice.

Allows one to choose **the field size**, **the type of magnetic interaciton** (whether its ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic) and then run Monte Carlo simulation for given number of steps to observe the evolution of the system.
